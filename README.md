This repository contains code and datasets to replicate our findings. There are two folders. **code** contains the Stata code to reproduce all tables and figures. **data** contains a cleaned Stata .dta file.  Retail fuel prices and RIN prices are missing and must be purchased from the [Oil Price Information Service](https://www.opisnet.com/).
